Sweet and salty Jesus, Gates.
Way to put us through the ringer.

But next time if you’re feeling blue
Just come by and ask for a drink.
Glad to have you back, Gates.

//Need to modify dialogue choices to:
//
//
//-Make sure you can 'play' as the character
//-Still give the player enough ways to express themselves or vent frustration.
//Not exactly sure how to break up moments where the player is not in dialogue and can explore the environment.
//Or how exactly to feed them into the next part of the dialogue. Would all this just be part of another script/document then?
//+g.hale@hoft.edu
//so as it stands I believe the system will require a different file for each interaction. We'll check what node the player ended on and have the game decide in engine what to do next.
//
//
//for example if they answer wrong in the airlock, the engine will recognize the dialogue ended at "# die in space" then allow the player to die in space, wait a while, and load the next file containing dialogue with the voice
//Okay... so would that mean we would need some sort of command to break them out of the script to allow them to explore? Otherwise wouldn't it just keep continuing?
//I imagine if a node ends without a link that's where the dialogue would end
//Oh. And then it'd just pick up on the next sequential node?
//no I think the best way to do it would seperate every dialogue sequence into a file, one for when they're in the airlock and another file for talking with the voice post mortem.
//Okay, I'm dumb--how does the system know when to start/stop running through the dialogue?
//it starts when the player starts some trigger, collision or interaction; it'll read through the dialogue file and start on the first node (I don't like this since nodes shouldn't have an implied order) then it'll continue dialogue until it reaches the end of a node without linking to another
//this way we wouldn't have the entire script loaded and have to keep track of where they are and where the next point is, especially useful for walking around openly talking to anyone in any order
//gotcha--so really I should create an internal note to myself where the breaks are and how we'll divide the files then?
//yes //comments would be a good use for that
//Accessible if they choose to speak to the crew.
//This is the first test to get rid of all dialogue options. With no choices, goal is for this to fall through to the IGNORE ME and have it point you to 'Try your best'
//This also falls through or should it point somewhere--is that kosher?

//[ar]as in how it comes up on screen? It isn't necessarily a thing of how the text writes to screen--it's about the pause/silence as you're dead before the next piece of dialogue comes in.
